## [Unreleased]

---

## [0.2.0] — 2026-03-09

### Added
- **`/watchtower-reset-password user:@user`** — new admin command. Clears a user's PIM password hash (sets it to `NULL`), simultaneously clears `lockedAt`, `blockedAt`, and resets `failedAttempts` to 0. Requires the Watchtower Admin role. The target user must run `/set-password` before they can elevate again. Their eligible role assignments are preserved.
- **`PASSWORD_RESET` audit event** — new `AuditEventType` value written to the `audit_logs` table on every successful password reset. Metadata includes `resetBy` (admin Discord user ID) and `isWatchtowerAdmin: true`. The event is echoed to the configured audit channel.
- **Null-password guard in `/elevate`** — when `PimUser.passwordHash` is `NULL`, `/elevate` returns a clear ephemeral error instructing the user to run `/set-password`. Fires after the `lockedAt` and `blockedAt` checks, before `verifyPassword`. No `FAILED_ATTEMPT` is recorded.
- **`/help` updated** — `/watchtower-reset-password` listed in the Admin Commands section.

### Changed
- `PimUser.passwordHash` is now nullable (`String?`). Existing non-null hashes are unaffected. The `NULL` state is the sentinel for "password cleared by admin".

### Migration
- `prisma/migrations/20260309000000_nullable_password_hash/migration.sql` — additive only:
  - `ALTER TABLE "pim_users" ALTER COLUMN "passwordHash" DROP NOT NULL` — allows `NULL`; no existing data modified
  - `ALTER TYPE "AuditEventType" ADD VALUE 'PASSWORD_RESET'`

## [0.1.0] — 2026-03-08

### Added
- **Role expiry notifications** — the expiry cron job now runs a warning scan each minute. When a session is within the configured warning window (`notifyBeforeMin`, default 5 min), the bot posts a message to the audit channel pinging the user with an **Extend Session** button. Clicking it resets `expiresAt` to a full new session and clears `notifiedAt` so the warning fires again near the new expiry.
- **Elevation-granted message with admin action buttons** — when a role is granted, the bot posts to the audit channel (preferred) or alert channel (fallback) with two admin-only buttons: **Remove Permission** (immediately revokes the elevation) and **Remove Permission and Block** (revokes and sets `PimUser.blockedAt`, preventing future elevations until unblocked).
- **`/watchtower-config notify-before`** — new integer option (0–60 min) to configure how many minutes before expiry the warning fires. Setting to `0` disables notifications. Default is 5. The config embed now shows an "Expiry Warning" field. A caution note is shown when `notify-before` exceeds `session-duration`.
- **`PimUser.blockedAt`** — new nullable field. Set by the "Remove Permission and Block" button. Prevents `/elevate` from proceeding; cleared by `/watchtower-unlock`.
- **`/watchtower-unlock` now clears `blockedAt`** in addition to `lockedAt` and `failedAttempts`. The command succeeds when either or both locks are set. Reply note indicates when a block was also cleared. Audit log metadata includes `clearedBlock: true` when applicable.
- **`src/lib/buttonHandlers.ts`** — new module containing all three button interaction handlers (`handleExtendSession`, `handleRemovePerm`, `handleRemovePermBlock`). Each handler re-fetches the elevation from DB, re-validates auth server-side, performs the action, writes an audit log, disables the button on the original message, and replies ephemerally.
- **Button routing in `interactionCreate.ts`** — new `isButton()` branch routes `extend_session:`, `remove_perm_block:`, and `remove_perm:` prefixes to their handlers. `remove_perm_block:` is checked before `remove_perm:` to prevent prefix collision.
- **Five new `AuditEventType` values**: `ELEVATION_EXPIRY_WARNING`, `ELEVATION_EXTENDED`, `ELEVATION_ADMIN_REVOKED`, `ELEVATION_ADMIN_REVOKED_BLOCKED`, `ELEVATION_BLOCKED`.
- **`writeAuditLog` `skipChannelPost` option** — new optional field on `AuditParams`. When `true`, suppresses the plain-text audit channel echo so callers that have already posted an interactive message do not produce a duplicate line. Used by `elevate.ts` (ELEVATION_GRANTED) and `expireElevations.ts` (ELEVATION_EXPIRY_WARNING).

### Changed
- `/watchtower-config` embed updated: "Expiry Warning" field added between "Session Duration" and "Lockout Threshold". Audit channel description updated to note it hosts interactive alerts.
- `/watchtower-unlock` command description updated to reflect that it also clears admin blocks.
- `/help` embed updated: `/watchtower-unlock` description updated; `/watchtower-config` description updated to mention expiry warning timing.
- `expireElevations.ts` refactored: cron callback now calls `runWarningScan()` then `runExpiryScan()` as separate named functions.

### Migration
- `prisma/migrations/20260308000001_add_expiry_notifications/migration.sql` — additive only:
  - `"notifyBeforeMin" INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 5` on `guild_configs`
  - `"notifiedAt" TIMESTAMP(3)` (nullable) on `active_elevations`
  - `"blockedAt" TIMESTAMP(3)` (nullable) on `pim_users`
  - Five new `AuditEventType` enum values via `ALTER TYPE ADD VALUE`

## [0.0.3] — 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Admin commands now have no `setDefaultMemberPermissions` call — they are visible to all users in the Discord UI, and `isWatchtowerAdmin()` is the sole runtime gate. Previously, commands were incorrectly hidden from the UI for non-Administrators, making the bot appear broken to legitimate Watchtower Admin role holders.
- Removed a stale `PermissionFlagsBits` import from all five admin command files left over from the `setDefaultMemberPermissions` removal.
- Fixed a TypeScript type error in `interactionCreate.ts` introduced when adding the `client` parameter to command `execute()` signatures.
- Moved `prisma` CLI from `devDependencies` to `dependencies` so that `prisma migrate deploy` runs correctly in the Docker runner stage (which strips dev deps via `npm ci --omit=dev`).

---

## [0.0.2] — 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- Migration `20260308000000_add_admin_role_id_to_guild_config` used `"admin_role_id"` (snake_case) for the new column, but the project's DB convention (set by the init migration) is camelCase. Prisma expected `"adminRoleId"`, causing a `P2022` crash on every command after deployment. Corrected to `"adminRoleId"`.
- Replaced deprecated `ephemeral: true` interaction option with `flags: MessageFlags.Ephemeral` across all 10 call sites (8 command files + `interactionCreate.ts`). Eliminates the `DeprecationWarning` logged on every interaction.

---

## [0.0.1] — 2026-03-08

Initial public release. Core PIM flow, help command, and decoupled bot management permissions.

### Added
- Core PIM flow: `/set-password`, `/elevate` with role selection menu, automatic session expiry via cron job
- Admin commands: `/watchtower-assign`, `/watchtower-revoke`, `/watchtower-list`, `/watchtower-unlock`, `/watchtower-config`
- `/help` slash command — ephemeral embed listing all commands grouped by audience with a Getting Started guide
- `src/lib/permissions.ts` — `isWatchtowerAdmin(member, config)` helper with bootstrap fallback to Discord `Administrator`
- `GuildConfig.adminRoleId` — configurable Watchtower Admin role; null = bootstrap mode (Administrator fallback)
- `/watchtower-config admin-role:@role` option to designate the Watchtower Admin role
- `AuditEventType.ADMIN_ROLE_CONFIGURED` audit event
- Immutable audit log written to DB and optionally posted to a Discord channel
- Per-guild configuration: session duration, lockout threshold, alert channel, audit channel
- bcrypt password hashing (12 rounds) with Zod complexity validation
- Account lockout after configurable N failed attempts; `/watchtower-unlock` to recover
- Jest test suite (75 tests across `permissions.test.ts`, `admin-guard.test.ts`, `help-command.test.ts`)
- Docker + Docker Compose setup; Portainer GitOps deployment support
- Automatic global slash command registration on bot startup via `ready` event

### Security
- Runtime `isWatchtowerAdmin()` guard on all five admin commands — `Manage Roles` alone is insufficient
- Elevated users cannot inherit bot management access through the elevation flow
- Watchtower Admin role is filtered from the `/elevate` role selection menu
- Audit log enriched with `isWatchtowerAdmin` flag on every admin action
